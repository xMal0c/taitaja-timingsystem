# Taitaja Timing System

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
<br>
It's currently in the early stages of development. You may experience bugs issues that could affect the functionality of the project.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12.x or later)
- npm/yarn/pnpm/bun (depending on your preference)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
